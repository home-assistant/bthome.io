<h2>Encryption</h2>

<p>
  BTHome is offering the option to use encrypted BLE advertisements to send your
  data. BTHome supports
  <a

    >AES encryption (CCM mode)</a
  >
  which works with a pre-shared key. When encrypted, the data can only be read
  by knowing the encryption key. The encryption key should be a 16 bytes long
  key (32 characters).
</p>

<h3 id="ble-advertising">Encrypting your messages</h3>
<p>
  We will demonstrate the encryption process with an example. Let's say you want
  to encrypt a temperature and humidity measurement, which are, in non-encrypted
  BTHome format
  <code style="word-break: break-word"> 02CA09 03BF13 </code>
</p>
<h3 id="input">The input</h3>
<p>
  First, we need to have the <strong>BTHome Device Information </strong> byte
  and the <strong>UUID</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    BTHome Device Information:
    <ul>
      <li>bit 0: “Encryption flag” <code>1</code> (encrypted)</li>
      <li>bit 1-4: “Reserved for future use”<code>0000</code> (not used)</li>
      <li>bit 5-7: “BTHome Version” <code>010</code> (version 2)</li>
    </ul>
    In bits, this becomes <code>01000001</code>. After converting this to a
    byte, we get
    <code>0x41</code>
  </li>
  <li>UUID: <code>0xFCD2</code>, reversed per byte we get <code>D2FC</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We also need an <strong>Encryption Key</strong>, which can be used to decode
  the data later. The Encryption Key should be 16 bytes long, e.g. key =
  <code>231d39c1d7cc1ab1aee224cd096db932</code>.
</p>
<p>
  We also need a <strong>Counter</strong>, which is a 4 bytes long value (unsigned
  32-bit little-endian integer), which should increase every advertisement. This
  counter can be used to implement the replay protection features of AES-CCM, but has
  to be implemented on the receiving side (e.g. by verifying that the counter has increased
  compared to the previous counter value).
  In the example we use <code>0x00112233</code> as value for the counter.
</p>
<p>
  Last thing we need is the <strong>MAC address</strong> of the sensor device,
  which is a 6 bytes long bytestring, e.g. <code>5448E68F80A5</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="encrypting">Encrypting the input</h3>
<p>
  To encrypt this data, we first create a so called
  <strong>nonce</strong> by combining the following information in one
  bytestring.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>MAC address <code>5448E68F80A5</code></li>
  <li>UUID <code>D2FC</code></li>
  <li>BTHome device data byte <code>41</code></li>
  <li>Counter <code>00112233</code></li>
</ul>
<p>nonce = <code>5448e68f80a5d2fc4100112233</code></p>
<p>
  Next, we can encrypt the nonce with the encryption key with the following
  command.
</p>
<code>
  from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES<br /><br />
  cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CCM, nonce=nonce, mac_len=4)<br />
  ciphertext, mic = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(data)
</code>
<p>
  This will return the <strong>Ciphertext</strong> (the encrypted data) and a 4
  byte <strong>Message Integrity Check (MIC)</strong>, which has to be appended
  to your BLE advertisement.<br /><br />
  Note that in BTHome V1 <code> cipher.update(b"\x11") </code> is used to add a header,
  to have the same encryption format as Xiaomi sensors. In BTHome V2, this header
  is not used anymore, make sure you remove this from your sensor firmware code
  when upgrading to BTHome V2.
</p>
<p>
  The final encrypted Service Data, which you can broadcast in your (encrypted)
  BLE advertisement, is composed as follows.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>UUID (reversed per byte)<code>D2FC</code></li>
  <li>BTHome device data byte <code>41</code></li>
  <li>Ciphertext <code>a47266c95f73</code></li>
  <li>Counter <code>00112233</code></li>
  <li>Message Integrity Check (MIC) <code>78237214</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Service Data = <code>d2fc41a47266c95f730011223378237214</code></p>

<h3 id="decryption">Decrypting your messages</h3>
<p>
  So, now we have encrypted our first message. But how to decrypt it? Let's
  assume you received the above service data
  <code>d2fc41a47266c95f730011223378237214</code>. Your sensor device will also
  broadcast its MAC address in the header. The only thing you need is the
  encryption key, which you should have written down when you encrypted the
  message.
</p>
<p>First, break down the service data into the following parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>UUID: First 2 bytes, should be <code>d2fc</code></li>
  <li>BTHome device data: 3rd byte, should be <code>41</code></li>
  <li>
    Ciphertext: 4th byte from the start till 8th byte from the end:
    <code>a47266c95f73</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Counter: 8th byte from the end till 4th byte from the end:
    <code>00112233</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Message Integrity Check (MIC): 4th byte from the end till the end:
    <code>78237214</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>With this information, we can recreate the <strong>nonce</strong> again.</p>
<ul>
  <li>MAC address <code>5448E68F80A5</code></li>
  <li>UUID <code>d2fc</code></li>
  <li>BTHome device data byte <code>41</code></li>
  <li>Counter <code>00112233</code></li>
</ul>
<p>nonce = <code>5448e68f80a5d2fc4100112233</code></p>
<p>
  With the Nonce, the MIC and the encryption key, we can decode the data with
  the following commands.
</p>
<code>
  from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES<br /><br />
  cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CCM, nonce=nonce, mac_len=4)<br />
  decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, mic)<br />
</code>
<p>
  The result will be the decrypted data <code>02ca09 03bf13</code> like we had
  on the top of this page.
