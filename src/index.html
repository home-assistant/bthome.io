        The Shelly BLU Button1 is a button device that is broadcasting in the BTHome 
        v2 format. It sends button events, like single, double, tripple or even long 
        click, which allows you to run different automations in your Home Automation 
        software with a single button.

      <p>
        BTHomeV2 ESP32 is an example of using an ESP32 to send BLE advertisement
        packets in the BTHome V2 format in such way that you have a very lightweight,
        energy efficient sensor. Between the broadcasting of BLE advertisements,
        the ESP32 will in a sleeping state, making it more suitable for battery
        powered sensors.

        BTHome-weather-station is an example of using the Espressif IoT
        Development Framework (ESP-IDF) to read sensor data and send BLE
        advertisement packets in the BTHome format. It includes reading data,
        encoding to BTHome format, deep sleep and utilization of multiple cores
        for speed. The aim is to be easily extensible for adding your own sensors
        using I2C.

<h2>
  BTHome is an open standard for broadcasting sensor data and button presses
  over Bluetooth LE
</h2>

<p>
  BTHome is an energy efficient but flexible BLE format for devices to broadcast
  their sensor data and button presses. Devices can run over a year on a single
  battery. It allows data encryption and is supported by popular home automation
  platforms, like

<h3 id="problem-solving">The problem we're solving</h3>

<p>
  Most Bluetooth devices are designed to be used with a smartphone app. They
  broadcast their data in a proprietary format that is not standardized. To be
  able to use these devices in your smart home, your home automation platform
  needs to support each proprietary format. This makes it difficult to use
  devices from different manufacturers in the same system.
</p>

<p>
  BTHome is an open standard that allows devices to broadcast their sensor data
  and button presses in a standardized format. Home automation systems now need
  to only adopt a single standard and BTHome devices will work out of the box.
</p>

<h3 id="scope-constraints">Scope & Constraints</h3>
<p>
  The goal of the BTHome standard is to share sensor data and button presses
  efficiently via Bluetooth LE discovery packets. It is not the goal to offer a
  way for devices to share control.
</p>

<p>
  The BTHome 16 bit UUID has been sponsored by <strong>Allterco</strong>, who
  purchased the UUID for us at the Bluetooth SIG organisation. Allterco is more
  familiar to most of you as Shelly. Alltreco has made a license available for
  everyone to use the format for free, as long as you follow the (V2) format
  that is defined on this website. If you want to develop devices with BTHome,
  and you want to asure that it is really free, you can
